// Incrementing a number by 1.
//! Write code here

// Decrementing a number by 1.
//! Write code here 
tall--;
console.log(tall)

// Multiplying a number by itself.
//! Write code here

//* Assigment 6:
/* Make a variable called userTitle and set the content equal to "Mr." if userMale is true,
or to "Mrs." if userMale is false. Use the TERNARY conditional to do this:

const variable = statement ? "this if true" : "this if not true"

Try changing userMale to both true and false and console.log your new variable,
to see that your conditional is working. */

//! Write code here
const userMale = true;

//* Assigment 8:
/*
Write a function that takes in 2 parameters:

 - A name (string)
 - An hour of the day (number)

The function should return:
"Good night (name received)" if the hour received is 0-6
"Good morning (name received)" if the hour received is 6-12
"Good day (name received)" if the hour received is 12-18
"Good evening (name received)" if the hour received is 18-24
"Invalid time" if the hour received is greater than 24

Use whichever function syntax you want.
Use template literal in your return: `This is a template literal ${variable}`

Example console.log(yourFunction("Gunnar", 19)) should console log Good evening Gunnar
Console log the function a few times to show that it's working. */

//! Write code here

//* Assignment 9:
/* Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as parameters.

In your function, check which of the numbers received is the largest,
then return the sum of the largest number divided by the smaller.

Use arrow function syntax.

Example: your function receives 13 and 24, it should return the sum of 24/13 */

//! Write code here
const checkNumber = (number1, number2) => Math.max(number1,number2)/Math.min(number1,number2)

EXTRA CHALLENGE

This is not mandatory, only for those who want an extra challenge.

Make a function called coolMaker that takes in 1 parameter.

If the parameter received is a string:
Return the string with "ðŸ˜Ž" added to the beginning and end

If the parameter received is a number:
Double it, convert it to a string and return it with "ðŸ˜Ž" added to the beginning and end.

If the parameter received is a boolean:
If the parameter received is true, return "ðŸ˜ŽYeahðŸ˜Ž". If the parameter received is false,
return "ðŸ˜ŽChillðŸ˜Ž"

If the parameter received is any other datatype:
Return "ðŸ˜ŽPrimitive values onlyðŸ˜Ž"

Use arrow function syntax.

Console log the function call with a few different datatypes to show that it's working
